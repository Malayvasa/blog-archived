## What is an NFT?

**Non-fungible tokens** (NFTs) are unique, digital items with blockchain-managed ownership. Examples include collectibles, game items, digital art, event tickets, domain names, and even ownership records for physical assets.

## Wth is fungible/fungibility?

Fungibility is defined as “able to replace or be replaced by another identical item”.

A currency is a classic example of a **fungible** asset. Ten Rupees is always Ten rupees no matter the serial number on the specific ten-rupee note, or whether its ten rupees sitting in your bank account.

The ability to replace a ten-rupee note with another ten-rupee note is what makes currency fungible.

Note that **fungibility is relative.**
Consider a sandwich, you might think that you can easily replace one moist-maker sandwich with another moist-maker sandwich. That is usually true unless you’ve developed a special attachment to your _particular_ moist-maker sandwich.

To get a better sense of what might constitute as a non-fungible asset, just think about most of the stuff you own. The chair you’re sitting in, your phone, your laptop, anything you could go and sell on eBay. All of these fall under the category of non-fungible things.
