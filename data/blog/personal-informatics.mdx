## What is Personal Informatics (PI)?

Personal informatics is a class of tools that help people collect personally relevant information for the purpose of self-reflection and self-monitoring by facilitating collection and storage of personal information, and by providing a means of exploring and reflecting on the information.

## Why do we need PI?

PI systems provide an advantage over simply trying to remember information about the self, because pure self-reflection is often flawed. People have very limited memory, reflecting by using memory alone makes it difficult to see patterns and trends.

## Current State of PI

The first and most widely-used model describing how people use personal informatics tools is Li et al.’s five stage model of personal informatics systems [4].

- Preparation, where the user starts collecting personal information;
- Collection, where she gathers data about himself;
- Integration, where the information collected are prepared and
  transformed for the user to reflect upon;
- Reflection, where the user reflects on his data;
- Action, where he chooses how to behave on the basis of his
  newfound understanding of herself.

## The Problem with current PI applications

Personal Informatics devices simply capture and display behavioral/ physiological results, such as the amount of steps taken or the level of blood pressure. Although their alleged claim is to boost self-reflection and encourage self knowledge, a description of this “self”, to which these knowledge endeavors are addressed, is missing in the current debate within Personal Informatics.

The self that these instruments quantify thus is reduced to the data pattern referred to the single behavior/parameter tracked, and the self-knowledge that they actually provide is mere information about how the user behaved in the past.

## Who is Personal Informatics designed for?

The structures that inform most Personal Informatics technologies follow are borrowed from behavior modification philosophies. resulting in a transfer of emphasis from the self to the behavior to be modified. Therefore, the selves that these devices can help expose becomes fractured through the individual actions that need to be changed.

Perhaps more obviously evident in the focus offered in the present Personal Informatics debate on the reactive results of self monitoring is a mindset that values actions over the self that causes them. Reactivity is the phenomenon by which a behavior is modified by the very method of capturing a behavior.

Focusing on behavior change has the immediate consequence that Personal Informatics frames itself within a utilitarian perspective whereby the self is shaped along the aims that people may have to track.

Activity trackers can be used in five different ways, namely to reach a goal, to document activities, to link different things together, to register achievements, and for a pure interest in data and technology [13].

However, it still maintains a utilitarian view of the individual’s self and of the act of self-reflection, which remains a means for “external” ends. Although not explicitly mentioned, the self here is actually defined by the motivations that people have to track their data and by the use they made of them.

We need to reframe the ways in which Personal Informatics can produce a change in its users, starting from their inner self instead of their behavior.

## How do we fix this?

Designers should be looking at to bring a shift in the "self" in Personal Informatics from the cognitive-behavioral paradigm to the phenomenological and constructivist paradigm. This needs to be done as our take on reality and ourselves is subjective, and that our knowledge and self knowledge are dynamically constructed.

Amon et al (2017) [14] further bring up the four different facets of the self: the present self, the past self, the future self and the interconnected self.

1. The present self is a flow of meaningful subjective experience.
2. The past self is a construction of the present self, a
   representation of itself at a time which supposedly has already
   been experienced and which is recalled through the act of
   remembering.
3. The future self consists of representations of ourselves as we
   might exist in alternate times.
4. The interconnected self consists of all the images of ourselves
   that come from our social interactions.

This paradigm of looking at the self in Personal Informatics in the form of four different facets helps us design a better association between the data captured and its meaning to the user.

## The Fix

1. Personal Informatics should reverse the point of view through which it looks at its constitutive elements, by providing subjective meanings instead of supposedly objective information, by supporting the construction of interpretations instead of the examination of numbers, and by focusing more on the self’s wellness than on behavior change.

2. The past is constructed by the present self based on the knowledge and the goals that it currently has and offers a resource for its present actions and plans. Personal Informatics
   systems should explore the possibility of reorganizing and presenting the past according to the user’s current needs, adapting to her self’s changing states and plans.

3. Displaying representations of possible future personal data is crucial to enhance self knowledge and improve strategic thought, motivations, and drives toward change. Personal Informatics systems should exploit predictions and simulations to provide, first, tools to explore and experiment alternate futures in order to stimulate self-reflection and reframe the present self with an enriched context of meanings; and, second, idealized or dreaded images of the self so to elicit strategies for respectively pursuing or avoiding such future states.

4. Allowing users to exchange perspectives on their own personal data with others is essential to improve self-understanding. Personal Informatics systems should support the creation of
   closed spaces of intimacy where users can expose the data they gathered, share the experiences connected with them, their feelings, interests, doubts and problems, as well as express and
   discover themselves through the confrontation with others.
